# Global Azure Bootcamp 2017 Science Lab #

There is a full description about the science behind the lab on the [Global Azure Bootcamp 2017 Science Lab page](https://global.azurebootcamp.net/science-lab-2017/)! 

You can use the lab as a example of how distributed cloud computing can solve real world (or in this case, real universe!) problems.
 
To take part in the Science Lab you will need to create an Azure Batch account and deploy some packages through Azure Resource Manager. 

To make this as painless as possible, there is a set of simple to follow instructions to both deploy and remove the Science Lab components. 

You can find instructions for the [Science Lab here](https://github.com/intelequia/GAB2017ScienceLab).
 
You will need a lab key which is of the form XYI-ZET-BMN.
 
To make things more interesting we have created a [dashboard](https://gablab2017.azurewebsites.net/) that allows you to see your "score" against others in your region or around the world.

You need **Windows 10** to set up the lab.

## Set-up details ##

Team Name is **GAB NZ Auckland**

Company Name is **Auckland GAB NZ**

Country Code is **NZ**

## Costs ##

The lab uses an Azure Automation Basic account and a Batch Account. 

The cost of Automation Account would be less than $1 for a full day. The Azure Batch service is free, Microsoft only charges for the underlying Virtual Machines used on the batch pool. 

So for example, if you deploy the science lab with 2 instances of A1 Linux VMs during 12 hours, the costs would be under $2.
